# Unit 5: Writing Classes

---
# How is this Unit Different?

1. We will begin writing in an `Object Oriented Programming` style (**OOP**).
2. This unit is more *design* focused than previous units.

---
# Why Design Classes?

* Writing classes allow us to create our own custom data-types
* We can often reuse code created in a class, especially if we plan on creating multiple instances.
* Instances of classes "own" their data, helping keep our code more organized.

---
# Pong Example

Writing Object Oriented Code allows us to take a more top down approach when designing software. For example, if I want to program the classic game Pong. I can first determine all the objects that will make up my finished project. Each of those object types can be it's own class.

# Designing a Class

1. The first step to designing a class, is identifying the `state` and the `behavior` that an instance of the class should have. UML diagrams are great tools for helping us do this.

# Writing the Class Signature
1. Declare your class `public`
2. Name your Class

	* Noun describing the Object Type
	
		* Good Names: `Ghost`, `Paddle`, `Brick`
		* Bad Names: `Lab14`, `CompSciProject`, etc
		* Exceptions: classes you aren't *instantiating* such as `Main`
		
	* Start with a Capital Letter
		* Always! - convention, not compiler enforced
		
	* Must match the Java filename
	
3. Curly Braces to hold the Class Definition code

	```java
	public class Paddle{
		// class definition code goes here
	}
	```

---
# Writing the Class Definition

Most classes contain the following 3 sections.  

1. **Attributes:** variables that store the state of an instance.
2. **Constructor(s):** instructions for creating an instance of the class.
3. **Methods:** instructions for the way an instance can behave (what it can do).

---
# Defining the state

Define a variable for every attribute our instances must have. A good UML diagram makes this easy!

![UML for Paddle](./PaddleUML1.png?raw=true)

ex.

```java

int x, y, width, height, speed;
boolean computerControlled;
Color color;

```
	
	
*Note:* We did not initialize these values. We'll save that job for when we write our constructor (next lesson).

---
# public vs. private

* It is the best practice to make attributes `private`.
* This enforces `encapsulation`
	* instances own their data, it is bundled with the object (encapsulated)
	* data can't be directly modified from other classes (simplifies debugging)
	* we write methods that specifically control how other classes can modify or access our data.
	* see demo

	```java
	private int x, y, width, height, speed;
	private boolean computerControlled;
	private Color color;
	```

# attributes are not local variables

**Attributes** are variables that are declared at the top of a *class*. They are **not** declared inside of a *method*. They are accessible everywhere throughout the class.

**Local Variables** are declared inside of a *method*. They belong to the method and are *not* accessible outside of that method.

ex.

```java

public class Paddle{
    private int x;

	public void move(){
	    int speed = 2;
	    x += speed;
	}
}

```

In the code above `x`, is an *attribute* of the `Paddle` class. Since `speed` is declared inside of a method, it is a *local variable* of the `move()` method.

---
# Instance vs. Static Attributes

Some attributes will be common to all members of a class, while others will be unique. For example, notice how both paddles share the same `width` and `height` values. If I never require a two paddles be different sizes, I can make these `static`. 

| attribute | leftPaddle | rightPaddle |
| --------- | ----- | ---- |
| color | white | green |
| width | 15px | 15px |
| height | 50px | 50px |
| speed | 5 | 6 |
| (x, y) | (20, 204)| (470, 53) |
| computerControl | true | false |

---
# static is a design based decision

`static` attributes are shared by the class. When we make instances of a class they don't each receive their own copy of these attribute. Whether this is the right decision or not depends on your design.  

In my Pong design, it is perfectly fine to share common width and height attributes across the class.

Because statics aren't tied to an instance, we should assign them at the same time they are declared.

ex.

```java

private static int width = 15;
private static int height = 50;

private int x, y, speed;
private boolean computerControlled;
private Color color;

```
---
# static does not mean constant!

static variables can still be changed, however changes to static variables will affect all instances. For example `width += 50`, will make both paddles 50px wider.

---
# static final variables

Many classes contain static variables that never need to be changed. These variables should be declared `static final`.  

By convention, they should be named with all capital letters.  

`static final` variables can be declared `public`. Why? Because compiler will enforce the `final` keyword, meaning no one can change your data anyway.  

In my Pong program, I'm not planning to change the size of the paddles so I'll refactor as shown below.

ex.

```java

public static final int WIDTH = 15;
public static final int HEIGHT = 50;

private int x, y, speed;
private boolean computerControlled;
private Color color;

```
