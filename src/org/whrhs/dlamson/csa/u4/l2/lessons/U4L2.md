# U4L2 Writing Constructors

Constructors are special methods used to create instances of our class. Writing a constructor allows us to control what happens when an object of our class is *instantiated*. We will typically initialize the instance attributes in our constructor. A class can have more than one constructor (*overloading*).
    
## Method Signature

Constructor method signatures are typically public and never include a return type. They will always share the name of the class and may include formal parameters.

`public Pacman(int xInit, int yInit)` 

## Method Definition

The method definition will initialize the new object's instance variables and execute any other commands that need to run on object creation. For our Pacman example, we will pass two integers to initialize Pacman's initial location. The `isAlive` and `lives` attributes are assigned default values.

```
public Pacman(int xInit, int yInit){
    x = xInit;
    y = yInit;
    isAlive = true;
    lives = 3;
}
```
