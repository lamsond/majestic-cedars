# U9:L1 Inheritance: Creating Superclasses and Subclasses

---
# The Three Principles of OOP

1. Encapsulation
2. **Inheritance**
3. Polymorphism

---
# What is Inheritance?

**Inheritance:** the ability to define a new class from an existing class.
**Superclass:** the class we are inheriting from. Can also be called the *Parent* class.
**Subclass:** the new class derived from the Superclass. Can also be called the *Child* class or *Derived* class.
 
---
# Why use Inheritance?

* Inheritance allows us to reuse code. Common attributes and behavior can be placed in a superclass. Objects of a subclass have access to these without needing to explicitly define them.
* Inheritance allows us to express hierarchical relationships between the classes in our programs.
